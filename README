StackBuffer is open source project providing HTML5 and CSS3 interface for StackOverflow API.

This project is actually experiment trying to prove that you can write only HTML5, 
CSS3 and JavaScript without need to do any backend programming. I consider 
this code as pretty bad so please don't use it. This was just prototype 
I build for myself and for fun. If I would start again from scratch I would 
build this app different way.
